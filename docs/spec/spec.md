# Introduction

This is the specification for the OracleDB standard library, which provides the functionality that is required to access and
manipulate data stored in an Oracle database in the [Ballerina programming language](https://ballerina.io/).
Ballerina is an open-source programming language for the cloud that makes it easier to use, combine, and create network
services.

# 1. Overview

This specification elaborates on usage of OracleDB `Client` object to interface with an Oracle database.

`Client` supports five database operations as follows,
1. Executes the query, which may return multiple results.
2. Executes the query, which is expected to return at most one row of the result.
3. Executes the SQL query. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
4. Executes the SQL query with multiple sets of parameters in a batch. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
5. Executes an SQL query, which calls a stored procedure. This can either return results or nil.

All the above operations make use of `sql:ParameterizedQuery` object, backtick surrounded string template to pass
SQL statements to the database. `sql:ParameterizedQuery` supports passing of Ballerina basic types or Typed SQL Values
such as `sql:CharValue`, `sql:BigIntValue`, etc. to indicate parameter types in SQL statements.

# 2. Client

Each client represents a pool of connections to the database. The pool of connections is maintained throughout the
lifetime of the client.

**Initialisation of the Client:**
```ballerina
# Initializes the Oracle database client.
#
# + host - Hostname of the Oracle database server
# + user - Name of a user of the Oracle database server
# + password - The password of the Oracle database server for the provided username
# + database - System identifier or the service name of the database
# + port - Port number of the Oracle database server
# + options - Oracle database connection properties
# + connectionPool - The `sql:ConnectionPool` object to be used within the client. If there is no
#                    `connectionPool` provided, the global connection pool will be used
# + return - An `sql:Error` if the client creation fails
public isolated function init(string host = "localhost", string? user = (), string? password = (), 
string? database = (), int port = 1521, Options? options = (), sql:ConnectionPool? connectionPool = ()) 
returns sql:Error?;
```

**Configurations available for initializing the OracleDB client:**
* Connection properties:
  ```ballerina
  # Provides a set of additional configurations related to the Oracle database connection.
  #
  # + ssl - SSL configurations to be used
  # + loginTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) to be used when connecting to the Oracle server and authentication (0 means no timeout)
  # + autoCommit - If true, commits automatically when the statement is complete
  # + connectTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) to be used when connecting to the Oracle server
  # + socketTimeout - Socket timeout (in seconds) to be used during the read/write operations with the Oracle database server
  #                   (0 means no socket timeout)
  public type Options record {|
      SecureSocket ssl?;
      decimal loginTimeout = 0;
      boolean autoCommit = true;
      decimal connectTimeout = 30;
      decimal socketTimeout?;
  |};
  ``` 
* SSL Connection:
  ```
  # SSL configurations to be used when connecting to the Oracle database server.
  #
  # + key - Keystore configuration of the client certificates
  # + cert - Truststore configuration of the trust certificates
  public type SecureSocket record {|
      crypto:KeyStore key?;
      crypto:TrustStore cert?;
  |};
  ```

## 2.1. Connection Pool Handling

Connection pool handling is generic and implemented through `sql` module. For more information, see the
[SQL Specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#21-connection-pool-handling)

## 2.2. Closing the Client

Once all the database operations are performed, the client can be closed by invoking the `close()`
operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients.

   ```ballerina
   # Closes the OracleDB client and shuts down the connection pool.
   #
   # + return - `()` or an `sql:Error`
   public isolated function close() returns Error?;
   ```

# 3. Queries and Values

All the generic `sql` queries and values are supported. For more information, see the
[SQL Specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#3-queries-and-values)

In addition to `sql` values, the `oracledb` package supports the following typed values for Oracle SQL data types,
1. ObjectTypeValue
2. VarrayValue
3. NestedTableValue

# 4. Database Operations

`Client` supports five database operations as follows,
1. Executes the query, which may return multiple results.
2. Executes the query, which is expected to return at most one row of the result.
3. Executes the SQL query. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
4. Executes the SQL query with multiple sets of parameters in a batch. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
5. Executes an SQL query, which calls a stored procedure. This can either return results or nil.
